 ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Management System ‚Äì Java Console Application by Anshdeep

A Java-based console project simulating a complete airline ticketing system with Admin, Agent, and Passenger roles. Supports booking, cancellations, seat classes, food options, simulated payments, and email confirmations (v2.0). Future versions will include QR codes and GUI.





## üìß Version 2.0 ‚Äì Email Confirmation  üöß Coming Soon

Implemented email sending using **JavaMail API** on every successful booking:

- Sends an email with:
  - Booking ID
  - Flight ID with route & time (`FL102 (IND-DEL, 6:00PM)`)
  - Food & seat class options
- Uses Gmail SMTP with `mail.properties` config
